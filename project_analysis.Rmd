**Check for outliers in the continuous variables**

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

Notice that there is a person who recorded their age at 253. We have to recode it correctly. We assume that they wanted to record 25 years.

We know that the maximum number of years a person can be using a Safaricom line in Kenya is 21 years. Therefore we replace those who quoted 50 and 52 years with the maximum number of years that Safaricom has been in the Kenyan market.

The cost of line also has many outliers, we'll therefore have to check the cost by looking at the age of the respondents and the number of years they have been using the line to ascertain the true cost of the line.

```{r}
# replace 253 years with 25 years
data1["Age"][data1["Age"] == 253] <- 25

# replace 50 and 52 years with 21 years
data1["Duration_p.line"][data1["Duration_p.line"] == 50] <- 21
data1["Duration_p.line"][data1["Duration_p.line"] == 52] <- 21

# cost of line
data1["cost_line"][data1["cost_line"] == 3000] <- 30
data1["cost_line"][data1["cost_line"] == 1800] <- 180

**Check for missing values**

```{r}

NA1 = sort(sapply(data5, function(x) 
  { 
  sum(is.na(x))
  } ))

NA1[which(NA1!=0)]

```


**Replace missing values**

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# A visual representation of the missing values

```

There are approximately 85% of values in the dataset with no missing values.There are approximately 14% missing values in duration of primary line, cost of line and job status.



```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Impute missing values in duration and cost of primary line using the mice package

- The log odds of not considering promotion factors relative to considering promotion factors is  5339 unit higher for being in Equitel  relative to Safaricom given other predictor variables  are held constant in the model

- The log odds of using primary line for business purpose  relative to personal purpose is 5010 unit higher for being in Equitel  relative to Safaricom given other predictor variables  are held constant in the model



**iii) Telkom relative to Safaricom**

- logit estimate for Telkom with relative to Safaricom when the predictor variables in the model are evaluated at zero, the odds ratio for preferring Telkom as the primary line to Safaricom decreases by 1709.7890887 units when other factors are held constant.

**2. Frequency Distributions**



**a) Highest number of respondents with respect to Gender**

```{r}
rpivotTable(data, rows = "pri_line",
            width = "100%",
            height = "400px")

```

**b) Distribution of Gender and age group with respect to primary line**

```{r}
# Categorize age the cost of the primary line

rpivotTable(data, rows = "pri_line", cols = c("Gender", "age_grp"),
            width = "100%",
            height = "400px")

```


**c) Distribution of Gender, age category against primary line**

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Group by age group and gender and primary line
rpivotTable(data, rows = c("pri_line", "cost"), cols = c("Gender", "age_grp"), 
            width = "100%",

- 3 respondents earn above Ksh. 50000, only one of the respondents has a monthly expenditure between 500-1500 and 2 of the respondents have a monthly expenditure of above Ksh.3500.

**Equitel**

- Most of the respondents (3) earn between 10000-30000; 2 of them spend above Ksh. 3500 and only 1 spends between 500-1500.

- The remaining monthly incomes had 1 respondent each.

**Safaricom**

- Majority of respondents (214) earn between 10000-30000; 94 of the respondent had a monthly expenditure of Ksh.500-1500 while 18 of the respondents spent above Ksh 3500

- 13 respondents earning above Ksh.50000 ;with 5 of these respondents having a monthly expenditure of Ksh.1501-3500, and 2 spending Ksh.500-1500 and below Ksh.500 monthly.

**Telkom**

- 19 respondents were the majority here who earned Ksh.10000-30000 and 12 of these respondents spent below Ksh.500 monthly, 1 respondent of these spending  above Ksh.3500.

- 3 respondents earned below Ksh.10000 where 2 respondents spent Ksh.500-1500 while the remaining respondent had a monthly expenditure of Ksh.1501-3500.

- Generally, across the primary lines of our consideration, majority of the respondents spent between 500 - 1500 which accounted for 41.3% while the least spenders (above 3500) accounted for 10.1%

**e) Frequency distribution table of primary line against age category and promotional strategies**

```{r, warning=FALSE}
rpivotTable(data, rows = "pri_line", cols = c("age_grp", "promotion_considered"), 
            width = "100%",
            height = "400px")


```

- 15 respondents (34.1%) from a total of 44 Airtel respondents, who were the majority came from the age of 17-30 considered promotional strategies when choosing their primary line and only 1 respondent was between the age of 65 - 75 and 75 -90 and accounted for 2.3% 

- Out of the 6 Equitel respondents, 3 (50%) were between the age of 30 - 45 years and did not consider promotional strategies when choosing their primary line and 1 between the age of 30 - 45 years respondent who accounted for 16.7% and considered promotional strategies when choosing a primary line.

- Out of 306 Safaricom respondents, 100 respondents between age 15-30 years chose Safaricom as their primary line basing on promotional strategies and accounted for 32.7%. 1 respondent came from the age between 65-75 years and considered promotional strategies when choosing their primary line.

- 10 (45.5%) of the total respondent of Telkom line were between 15-30 considered promotional strategies when choosing their primary line. 1 respondent (4.5%) between the age of 30-45 and 1  respondent (4.5%) between 45-60 years did not consider promotional strategies.

- Generally, 125 respondents (33.1%) were between 15-30 years who considered promotional strategies and 1 respondent (1.1%) was between age 75-90 who did not consider promotional strategies. Safaricom registered the highest number of respondents 306 (81%) and had 6 respondents (1.6%)

**f) Service clarity rating with respect to gender and Primary line**

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
rpivotTable(data, rows = c("pri_line", "Gender"), cols = c("service_clarity", "Rating"), 
            width = "50%",
            height = "400px")

```

From the analysis,75% of the female Safaricom subscribers with excellent service clarity gave a rating of 1 while 25% of the Safaricom subscribers with excellent service clarity gave a rating of 1, 81% of the total respondent subscribed to safaricom.25%  and 12.5% of females and males respectively  subscribed to  Airtel services with good service clarity gave Airtel service a rating of 2 .50% 0f females and males subscribed to Telkom with poor services  clarity  gave the service provider a rating of 4. Finally, 25% of females subscribed to Equitel with excellent service clarity gave a rating of 2, 2% of the respondent subscribed to Equitel

**g) Distribution of primary line in relation to job status and monthly expenditure**

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
rpivotTable(data, rows = c("pri_line", "Job_status"), cols = "monthly_exp", 
            width = "100%",
            height = "400px")

```



```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
rpivotTable(data, rows = c("pri_line", "Job_status"), cols = "m_income", 
            width = "100%",
            height = "400px")

```

**Relationship between primary line and perceived price fairness**

We would like to test the hypothesis at 95% confidence interval:

  - Ho: There is no relationship between primary line and cost of line
    
    against
    
  - Ha: There is a relationship between primary line and cost of line.
  

```{r}
summary(aov(data$cost_line ~ data$pri_line))

qf(.95, 3, 374)

```

**Decision and conclusion**

Since the f-statistic = 3.1 x 10^-9 < f-tabulated = 2.63, we reject Ho and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to show that there is a relationship between primary line and the cost of line.
